##Top Pot Object

For this assignemt I used a constructor function to convey how many donuts a Top Pot shop will need at any given hour of a day. 
I started by naming the properties and perameters of a Top Pot store. I then set up a for loop to set a normal time frame for a normal day at any of their stores, telling the loop to cease when 11 hours, or 6pm, hit. 

I determined the amount of donuts needed by creating a variable that gives me a random number within the minimum and maximum amout of foot traffic a specific store sees a day. After that is determined, another variable multiplies the given percentage of customers that buy something from the store with the projected number given through our previous variable and multiple that answer with the average amount of donuts needed per person.

I then specified the perameters for each specific location, and cleaned up my indentations to complete the assignment.
